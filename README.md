# wAIste Flask Server

Welcome to the wAIste Flask Server repository! This repository contains the backend code for the wAIste waste management application. wAIste utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze images of waste items and provide personalized recommendations for proper disposal methods.

## Overview

The wAIste Flask Server serves as the backend API for the wAIste mobile application. It handles image processing and interacts with machine learning models to categorize waste items and detect garbage. This server plays a crucial role in facilitating communication between the frontend mobile app and the AI models, enabling real-time waste management recommendations for users.

## Features

- **API Endpoints:** Provides endpoints for image upload and inference.
- **Integration with AI Models:** Utilizes the Roboflow platform's inference SDK to integrate with machine learning models for waste categorization and garbage detection.
- **Efficient Communication:** Ensures seamless communication between the frontend mobile app and AI models, enabling quick and accurate waste management recommendations.
